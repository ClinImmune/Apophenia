Apophenia is an open statistical library for working with data sets and statistical or simulation models. It provides functions on the same level as those of the typical stats package (such as OLS, probit, or singular value decomposition) but gives the user more flexibility to be creative in model-building. Being in C, it is often an order of magnitude faster when searching for optima or running MCMC chains. The core functions are written in C, but bindings exist for Python (and they should be easy to bind to in Perl/Ruby/&c.)

http://apophenia.info/gentle.html provides an overview of the basics of using the library.  If you want to know more about the package, see the web site, http://apophenia.info, or have a look at the textbook from Princeton University Press that coevolved with Apophenia, downloadable from http://modelingwithdata.org .


The quick summary for installation:

--The library depends on the GNU Scientific Library and SQLite3. If you are using a system with a package manager of some sort, there is certainly a package for them. Be sure to include both the main package and the lib-, -dev, or -devel package. Sample package manager calls:

sudo apt-get install make gcc libgsl0-dev libsqlite3-dev 
or 
sudo yum install make gcc gsl-devel libsqlite3x-devel

--To build from this git repository, you will need to have Autotools installed [try (apt-get || yum install) autoconf automake libtool ], because the first step in the build process is to use Autotools to generate the build package. If you can't install Autotools, use the pre-built package from Sourceforge; see below.

--Got Autotools? Great, then run:

./configure
cd apophenia-0.99
make 
sudo make install


--The prebuilt package, that has only basic requirements and doesn't require Autotools, can be downloaded from Sourceforge (because GitHub stopped supporting downloads):
https://sourceforge.net/projects/apophenia/files/latest/download?source=files

Thanks for your interest. I do hope that Apophenia helps you learn more from your data.
