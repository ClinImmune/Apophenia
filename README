This is a library of statistical functions in C, plus some command-line
utilities that make use of those functions. 

The directory you are in right now, however, is the development
side---backstage, so to speak. You can't directly compile anything from
this directory.

Instead, you can run the make_pkg script to produce compilable
end-distributions in the dists directory.

The make_pkg script will:

--Copy everything into a temp directory, so GNU autotools can make a mess.
--run a few sed scripts to turn some notes in the C code into proper ISO C.
--Make some minor fixes, like update version numbers and overwrite this
readme to you with readme.user.
--Run GNU autotools, which will produce the familiar configure script.
--Produce a debian package (currently unmaintained---volunteers sought).

At the end of this, you will be able to go to the dists directory
and either install the debian pkg (if it compiled) and/or go to the
apophenia-0.xx subdirectory and run ./configure;make;sudo make install
as usual.

By the way, the Apophenia end-distribution attempts to be
standards-compliant, but the make_pkg script and such is a little
looser. E.g., it uses sed -i, which is common but not POSIX-standard. If
you're working on the development side of a stats library for C, then
you probably have the technical know-how to make these things work for
your environment.

Thanks for your interest. I do hope that Apophenia helps you learn more
from your data.

PS: Lawyers, please not that COPYING and COPYING2 files can be found in
the install/ directory.
