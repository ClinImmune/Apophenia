This is a library of statistical functions in C, plus some command-line
utilities that make use of those functions. 

If you want to know more about the package, see the web site,
http://apophenia.info, or have a look at the textbook from Princeton
University Press that coevolved with Apophenia, downloadable from
http://modelingwithdata.org . 

Detailed setup instructions can be found at
http://apophenia.sourceforge.net/doc/setup.html .

The executive summary:
--You need the usual C compiler and the supporting environment that a
sane programmer requires. 

--The library makes an effort to not reinvent already-developed systems
like matrix inversion or database querying, which means that the package
has several dependencies. You need the GNU Scientific Library (wich needs
a BLAS like libgslcblas or lapack), and are strongly encouraged to have a
database system, either SQLite or mysql (if not sure, install sqlite3). If
you are using a system with a package manager of some sort, there is
certainly a package for all of these. Be sure to include both the main
package and the lib-, -dev, or -devel package. On my Ubuntu system,
I'd run this package-install command:

apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-bin libblas3gf liblapack3gf sqlite3 libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev

--There is an optional Python interface, which will require all of the above plus the
swig and Python-dev packages.

--One you have it in place,

tar xzf apophenia-X.XX.tar.gz 
cd apophenia-X.XX
./configure; make; sudo make install

should compile for you.

--Once you have it installed, the user manual is in the form of a textbook
on statistical computing at http://modelingwithdata.org and the
command-by-command reference is at http://apophenia.info/doc . You can
make the online documentation yourself if you have Doxygen installed,
via make doc.
