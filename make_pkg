#This script is intended for maintainers who are modifying the 
#package as it appears on sourceforge.net. If you are a user who 
#just wants to compile and use the package, you don't need this; 
#see the README.

#This script copies everything into a junk directory, that GNU's 
#prep materials will produce a thousand temp files in, concluding 
#with a file named apophenia-N.NN.tar.gz. Once that it is ready
#for distribution, the tar.gz arcive is copied to the main directory
#and this junk directory is erased. 
#Finally, the script unzips the archive and compiles from the archive.
