--This version includes a server to park itself in memory and receive data
processing requests. The intent is that one can then do analysis from
the command line or a Perl/Python/Whatever script. The client/server
works in the sense of handling a handful of requests without
segfaulting, but remains in proof-of-concept stage. 
--Added apop_merge_db for joining databases, both via C and command line 
--Run t tests from the cmd line or the database.

Flattened the relatively complex vasprintf subsystem from GNU, so if
you've been having trouble compiling on non-GNU systems, try again.
Added two little command-line programs. Also, added more little
functions which aren't very interesting, like t-tests; maybe you'll
stumble upon them.
