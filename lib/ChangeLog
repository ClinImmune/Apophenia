--Bar charts (assuming you've got Gnuplot > 4.1
--percentiles (in case you haven't)
--redid MLE system so you can pick among the many options now available.  As a part of this:
	--better handling of constraints.
	--numerical gradients.

0.12 	early November 2005, post-hiatus

You now have three maximum likelihood estimators to choose from: the
GSL's no-gradient, the GSL's with-gradient, and Mr. WN's autocalculated
gradient. 

If you haven't seen it before, the apop_distribution structure is
increasingly well-supported. It allows the user to specify the features
of the Max. Likeihood model in a consistent manner which facilitates
things like comparing two models.

I'd still suggest taking the Waring and Yule distributions with care;
everything else seems to check out.


0.12 	September 2005
--The distributions are now objects, which just provides a neat way
of grouping together the half-dozen functions which are associated with
any one distribution.

0.11	September 2005
--command-line server is much improved. I actually do work with it.
--Documentation is now via doxygen.
--asst bug fixes.
--Have started to take plotting (via gnuplot) seriously
--a limited test suite. Try: make test .

0.10	August 2005
--This version includes a server to park itself in memory and receive data
processing requests. The intent is that one can then do analysis from
the command line or a Perl/Python/Whatever script. The client/server
works in the sense of handling a handful of requests without
segfaulting, but remains in proof-of-concept stage. 
--Added apop_merge_db for joining databases, both via C and command line 
--Run t tests from the cmd line or the database.

0.09	July 2005
Flattened the relatively complex vasprintf subsystem from GNU, so if
you've been having trouble compiling on non-GNU systems, try again.
Added two little command-line programs. Also, added more little
functions which aren't very interesting, like t-tests; maybe you'll
stumble upon them.

0.08	May 2005
--OLS/GLS/MLE now properly support the apop_estimate structure 
--Column names

0.07	April 2005
--uses the apop_estimate structure to return heaps of data from regressions & MLEs
--uses the apop_model structure

0.06
--var(x), skew(x), kurtosis(x) added to SQL understood by Apophenia.

0.05
--added a little crosstab utility
--queries now accept printf-type arguments. 
	==>GNU vasprintf was added.
		==>updated to work with autoconf 1.7
